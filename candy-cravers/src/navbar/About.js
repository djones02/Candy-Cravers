          nostalgic ~ It brings joy ~ it brings us together. Opening that
          colorful candy wrapper is like unwrapping a gift on Christmas! You
          know there is something good inside. Decadently smooth chocolate,
          wild-sour tart, or sweet fruity goodness, candy is as diverse as every
          shade of the rainbow. And we want you to be able to taste them all.
          Weâ€™re suckers for sweets and love making sure we get them into your
          hands.
